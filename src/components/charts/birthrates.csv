Argentina,ARG,Latin America & Caribbean,Upper middle income,"National Institute of Statistics and Census revised national accounts from 2004-2015. Argentina, which was temporarily unclassified in July 2016 pending release of revised national accounts statistics, is classified as upper middle income for FY17 as of September 29, 2016.

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.",23.682,23.459,23.242,23.038,22.857,22.709,22.602,22.546,22.547,22.61,22.759,23.02,23.387,23.833,24.318,24.77,25.107,25.273,25.243,25.017,24.63,24.145,23.646,23.198,22.833,22.563,22.379,22.239,22.106,21.967,21.804,21.603,21.366,21.097,20.804,20.501,20.21,19.948,19.727,19.55,19.413,19.302,19.199,19.091,18.97,18.836,18.695,18.553,18.417,18.285,18.154,18.019,17.875,17.717,17.547,17.364

Fragile and conflict affected situations,FCS,,,"Fragile and conflict affected situations aggregate. Countries with fragile situations are primarily International Development Association-eligible countries and nonmember or inactive countries and territories with a 3.2 or lower harmonized average of the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rating and the corresponding rating by a regional development bank, or that have had a UN or regional peacebuilding and political mission (for example by the African Union, European Union, or Organization of American States) or peacekeeping mission (for example, by the African Union, European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or Organization of American States) during the last three years. The group excludes IBRD countries (for which the CPIA scores are not publically disclosed); unless there is the presence of a peace-keeping or political/peacebuilding mission.
